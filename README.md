##### Authentication 
> The application locks out Client's IPs after five (5) unsuccessful logins. Be careful when choosing a password and username.

### Running the application (Backend Service):

The application has no interactive frontend UI. Ergo, you'll need [PostMan](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) installed to run the service successfully.

Like to run locally? You'll need more than PostMan. Kindly install
- Node.js
- Redis

### Install Dependencies
```shell 
  npm i
```

### Start Local Server

```shell
  npm run server 
```

or 

```shell
  npm start
```

> Make sure you add `.env` file in the root directory of the project else everything fails.
  You'll need to use your configurations and tokens for service depicted in `.env.example`. Some service includes [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration), [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/s3-example-creating-buckets.html), and [PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/payments/paypal-payments/).
